# Project 1: Descriptive Analysis of Indian Startup Funding

## Problem Statement
Startup funding data often contains extreme values due to a small number of unicorns and late-stage funding rounds.
Using simple averages can therefore be misleading.

This project focuses on using descriptive statistics to understand the true nature of startup funding in India.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze central tendency measures (mean, median, mode) for startup funding
- Understand variability using variance, standard deviation, and IQR
- Identify and interpret outliers rather than blindly removing them
- Build strong statistical intuition before applying any machine learning

---

## Why This Dataset
- Funding data is naturally skewed
- Contains real-world outliers
- Ideal for demonstrating why median and IQR often outperform mean and variance in business reporting

---

## Key Concepts Covered
- Mean vs Median in skewed distributions
- Variance vs Standard Deviation (interpretability vs mathematical convenience)
- Outlier detection using IQR
- Distribution shape analysis

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

## Learning Outcome
This project is intentionally focused on *understanding data behavior* rather than building predictive models.
The goal is to develop intuition that translates directly to interviews and real-world analytics work.
