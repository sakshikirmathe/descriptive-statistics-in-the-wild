    "## Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Funding data is highly right-skewed**\n",
    "   - Mean funding is significantly higher than the median due to a small number\n",
    "     of very large funding rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Median is a better measure of “typical” startup funding**\n",
    "   - While the mean funding exceeds $18M, the median remains close to $1–2M,\n",
    "     indicating that most startups raise much smaller amounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dispersion is extremely high**\n",
    "   - Standard deviation is comparable to or larger than the mean, highlighting\n",
    "     high variability in funding outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Outliers are structurally important**\n",
    "   - Approximately 13–14% of funding rounds are identified as outliers using the IQR method.\n",
    "   - These represent legitimate late-stage or unicorn investments, not data errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Outliers disproportionately influence averages**\n",
    "   - Removing IQR-defined outliers reduces the mean funding by nearly 6×,\n",
    "     while the median changes only marginally."
